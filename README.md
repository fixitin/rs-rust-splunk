# rs-rust-splunk
Rust-[splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/about-splunk.html) is intended to be a clone of the famous [gosplunk site](https://gosplunk.com/). This toy project allows me to get my hands on rust and learn web development via the [Rocket framework](https://rocket.rs/).

<b>Why learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)? </b>
<ul>
  <li>If you are looking for a powerful, safe, and modern language to learn, then Rust is a great option.</li>
  <li>strong performance, memory safety, concurrency features, and modern language features are parts of Rust language.</li>
  <li>Learning Rust is a challenging but rewarding experience. It will teach you new ways of thinking about programming.</li>
  <li>It's cool!</li>
</ul>

<b>Why building a gosplunk clone?</b>

Because I want to have fun with the rocket framework so that I can actually experience its versatility and get my hands dirty with a project that can come in handy for my work.
  
I want to bring features that are currently not present on gosplunk and also have a personal copy of the project on my local server that runs faster and is enriched with many more Splunk searches with examples and explanations. Currently a well-documented page for each search is what is missing on gosplunk and I find that for those starting out with Splunk it is vitally important.
